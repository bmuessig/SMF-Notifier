# CodeWalrii-Notifier
API and Client application originally designed for thew CodeWalr.us forum to have a visual notification on new posts.
Works on any SMF forum with its feed enabled.
Just change the constants in the server PHP file to allow it to run for other servers.


The server needs PHP to run. Any normal PHP5 installation will work. Read and write access rights are required for the PHP file in the folder it is located in.
The client requires .NET Framework >= 4 and Gtk# from http://download.xamarin.com/GTKforWindows/Windows/gtk-sharp-2.12.26.msi installed.
